<title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
        Welcome to the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK)
        Developer's Guide.
        This manual provides information that lets you use both the standard
        Yocto Project SDK and an extensible SDK to develop applications and
        images using the Yocto Project.

    <para>
        Prior to the 2.0 Release of the Yocto Project, application
        development was primarily accomplished through the use of the
        Application Development Toolkit (ADT) and the availability
        of stand-alone cross-development toolchains and other tools.
        With the 2.1 Release of the Yocto Project, application development
        has transitioned to within a more traditional SDK and extensible
        SDK.
